        I am a final-year computer science student expected to graduate in December 2025. 
        With this in mind, I am looking for internships and graduate roles where I can apply the skills 
        from my studies and leverage my impact.

        In a world where our lives are already so visually-saturated, I wanted to create a portfolio that focused
        on the content and reading experience itself.
